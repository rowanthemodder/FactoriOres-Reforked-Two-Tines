Welcome to the FactoriOres repository. 

Update pending, I need to fix my dev environments again.

FactoriOres is a [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) mod which adds special ore deposits and machines which can automatically mine them, inspired by the game [Factorio](https://www.factorio.com).

Full credit to Seraphaestus and David Aires for earlier versions, they made this possible.
